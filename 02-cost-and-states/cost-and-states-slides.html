# Sequence Learning

## Cost and States

# Today's Menu

### Better auto-correct using custom cost functions

### From edit distance to DTW with feature data

### From pair-wise DTW to state-based decoding

# Better Auto-Correct

- Compute cost of substitution by proximity of keys
- Map keys to grid, compute euclidean distance
- What about for example `g <> h`, or `a <> l`?

Outlook: [Damerau-Levenshtein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damerau%E2%80%93Levenshtein_distance#Distance_with_adjacent_transpositions) with adjacent transpositions.

# DTW with Feature Data

Edit distance between two waveforms?

# DTW with Feature Data

- Raw sample data way to numerous
- Compute spectral (cepstral) features, eg. [MFCC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mel-frequency_cepstrum)
- Use euclidean distance on feature vectors
- Uniform cost for substitution/deletion/insertion


## Isolated Word Recognition

- Have prototype recordings for each word
- Compute "distance" between test recoding and prototype words
- Choose for word with least difference

# Decoding States with DP

- Don't compare to _individual class prototypes_
- Compare to _class prototypes_
- Since we relaxed the time constraint on the prototype axis, you must compute the minimum for all state transitions.
